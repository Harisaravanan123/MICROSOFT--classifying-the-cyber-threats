# MICROSOFT--CLASSIFYING THE CYBER SECURITY THREATS
THE MAIN OBJECTYIVE OF THE PROJECT IS  TO DEVELOP A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL FOR MY COMPANY MICROSOFT , WHICH ACCURATELY PREDICTS THE TRIAGE GRADE OF CYBER SECURITY INCIDENTS .I WANT TO CREATE A CLASSIFICATION  MODEL  WHICH CLASSIFIES AS TRUE POSITIVE , BENIGN POSITIVE AND FALSE POSITIVE BASED ON THE HISTORICAL EVIDENCES AND CUSTOMER RESPONSES.

# TOOLS
* PANDAS
* NUMPY
* SCIKIT-LEARN
* SEABORN

# DATA PREPROCESSING
* WE HAVE TWO TYPES OF DATASET ONE IS TRAIN DATASET AND ANOTHER ONE IS TEST DATASET. FIRST, WE DID PREPROCESSING FOR TRAIN DATASET.
* I TOOK 15 LAKHS DATA SAMPLES FROM THE TRAIN DATASET BY INCIDENT GRADE (TARGET COLUMN) TO AVOID CLASS IMBALANCES.
* I REMOVE NULL VALUES COLUMNS WHICH ARE MORE THAN 50% OF THE TOTAL DATASET . 
* THEN I CHECK FOR DUPLICATES AND REMOVE THE DUPLICATES THAT PRESENT IN THE COLUMNS.
* I DID THE SAME PREPROCESSING FOR THE TEST DATASET ALSO.

# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

* THE ABOVE GRAPH SHOWS THE COUNT OF INCIDENT GRADE BY ENTITY TYPE.
* THE ENTITY TYPE  INTERNET PROTOCOL [IP] CONSISIT OF HIGH NUMBER OF MORE THAN 1 LAKH 40 THOUSAND TRUE POSITIVE THREATS FILED. 
* THE SECOND ENTITY TYPE WAS USER WHICH CONSISIT OF NEARLY 1 LAKH 20 THOUSAND TRUE POSITIVES, WHICH IS VERY THREATENING .  SO,  WE WANT TO CONCENTRATE ON THESE TWO ENTITY TYPES.

* FROM THE ABOVE GRAPH, THE CITY NAMED 10630 RECORED A VERY HIGH NUMBER OF THREATS COMPARED TO ANY OTHER CITIES IN THE DATASET.
* IT CONSIST OF NEARLY 4 LAKH TRUE POSITIVES, 5 LAKH BENIGN POSITIVES AND 4LAKH 50 THOUSAND FALSE POSITIVES . IT IS THE ONLY CITY WHICH RECORED 80% THREATS.

* FROM THE ABOVE GRAPH, THE STATE 1445 CONSIST OF HIGHEST NEARLY 90 PRECENT THREAT COMPARED TO ALL OTHER STATE.
* WE WANT TO INCREASE THE SECURITY TO THIS PARTICULAR STATE TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO FUTHER THREATS WILL RECEIVE  IN THIS STATE.

# ENCODING AND PCA(PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS)

* THERE ARE ABOVE 2000 UNIQUE VALUES IN MOST OF THE COLUMNS IN THE TRAIN AND TEST DATASET. FIRST IN MY TRAIN DATASET, I TOOK THE TOP3 VALUES IN ALL THE COLUMNS , WHICH HAS HIGH COUNT. THEN I CHANGED ALL THE REAMINING VALUES AS OTHERS IN MY DATASET. SINCE THE DATAS ARE NOMINAL DATA , I USED ONE HOT ENCODER TO ENCODE THE COLUMNS.
* AFTER ENCODING THE TRAIN DATASET , I PICKLED ALL THE ENCODED COLUMNS IN A DICTIONARY . 
* THEN I DID SCALING THE FEATURES BY USING STANDARD SCALER TO ENSURE THAT ALL THE FEATURES IN THE DATASET CONSIST OF MEAN=0 AND VARIANCE =1.
* THEN I APPLY THE SCALED DATA TO PCA TO REDUCE THE LARGER DIMENSIONALITY INTO SMALL AND MEANINGFULL DIMENSIONS.
* THEN I READ ALL THE PICKLED FILE OF ENCODERS,SCALER AND PCA TO TRANSFORM THE TEST DATASET. 

# MODEL TRAINING AND EVALUATION

* I USED TOTTALY 5 MACHINE LEARNING MODEL TO TRAIN AND TEST THE DATASET.
* THE MODEL THAT I USED ARE :
                          1. LOGISTIC REGRESSION
                          2. DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER
                          3. RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER
                          4. GRADIENT BOOSTING CLASSIFIER
                          5. XGBOOST CLASSIFIER
* I USED STARTIFIED K-FOLD CV TO ELIMINATE THE SAMPLING BIAS WHILE PERFORMING THE TRAIN TEST SPLIT.

# CONCLUSION

Leveraging machine learning for cybersecurity incident classification enhances SOC efficiency by reducing false positives and enabling faster threat response. Our model, optimized using macro-F1 score, precision, and recall, ensures accurate triage grading for improved security posture. This approach lays the groundwork for automated threat detection, driving smarter and more proactive cybersecurity solutions.
