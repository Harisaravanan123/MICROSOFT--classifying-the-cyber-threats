# MICROSOFT--CLASSIFYING THE CYBER SECURITY THREATS
THE MAIN OBJECTYIVE OF THE PROJECT IS  TO DEVELOP A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL FOR MY COMPANY MICROSOFT , WHICH ACCURATELY PREDICTS THE TRIAGE GRADE OF CYBER SECURITY INCIDENTS .  I WANT TO CREATE A CLASSIFICATION  MODEL  WHICH CLASSIFIES AS TRUE POSITIVE , BENIGN POSITIVE AND FALSE POSITIVE BASED ON THE HISTORICAL EVIDENCES AND CUSTOMER RESPONSES.

# TOOLS
* PANDAS
* NUMPY
* SCIKIT-LEARN
* SEABORN

# DATA PREPROCESSING
* WE HAVE TWO TYPES OF DATASET ONE IS TRAIN DATASET AND ANOTHER ONE IS TEST DATASET. FIRST, WE DID PREPROCESSING FOR TRAIN DATASET.
* I TOOK 15 LAKHS DATA SAMPLES FROM THE TRAIN DATASET BY INCIDENT GRADE (TARGET COLUMN) TO AVOID CLASS IMBALANCES.
* I REMOVE NULL VALUES COLUMNS WHICH ARE MORE THAN 50% OF THE TOTAL DATASET . 
* THEN I CHECK FOR DUPLICATES AND REMOVE THE DUPLICATES THAT PRESENT IN THE COLUMNS.
* I DID THE SAME PREPROCESSING FOR THE TEST DATASET ALSO.

# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

*THE ABOVE GRAPH SHOWS THE COUNT OF INCIDENT GRADE BY ENTITY TYPE.
*THE ENTITY TYPE  INTERNET PROTOCOL [IP] CONSISIT OF HIGH NUMBER OF MORE THAN 1 LAKH 40 THOUSAND TRUE POSITIVE THREATS FILED. 
*THE SECOND ENTITY TYPE WAS USER WHICH CONSISIT OF NEARLY 1 LAKH 20 THOUSAND TRUE POSITIVES, WHICH IS VERY THREATENING .  SO,  WE WANT TO CONCENTRATE ON THESE TWO ENTITY TYPES..
